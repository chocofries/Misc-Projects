[AnimPaint 0.0.1]

AnimPaint is a lightweight painting and animation solution for Windows OS.

When an animation is done, the user can sequentially save their frames in a file and import
them into a video editing solution of their choice.

Double-click on the AnimPaint executable file to open, and start on your masterpiece!
