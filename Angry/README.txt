ANGRY

Controls:
Left mouse button to drag the slingshot (which is the big circle in the level), release mouse
to release the balls called Angrys. The enemies look like spikey balls and are called Evils.
You can click the left mouse button again during flight to activate an Angry's special ability.
There are three different types of Angry, there is one that dashes when you activate its ability,
one that shoots out balls like a shotgun, and another that explodes like a bomb.

There are four levels.
Kill the Evils to win a level, but if you use up all of your Angrys before the Evils are destroyed
then you will lose the level and have to restart.
